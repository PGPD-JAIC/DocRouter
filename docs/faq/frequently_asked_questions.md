# DocRouter FAQ
Frequently asked questions about DocRouter

## Who are you?
DocRouter was build by the JAIC. This help site is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means that, unlike DocRouter itself, this help site is available on the public internet. We've used Github Pages to host this site because it is much easier to update the site content on a GitHub Page than on a page hosted within DocRouter. 

## What is DocRouter?
DocRouter is the result of an idea that came from our frustration with the lack of tools for quickly and effectively managing property items in the records management system. We thought that we could build a better interface using the web and, hopefully, make many of the common property management tasks a little easier. 

## Is DocRouter secure?
DocRouter uses [Windows Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/windows-authentication-overview) to authenticate users and restricts access to the application to only users with current, valid Windows credentials. When you log on to DocRouter, you may be prompted to provide your Windows username and password, but you are providing this information *to Windows itself,* not DocRouter. Windows simply validates your credentials and tells DocRouter if you are who you say you are. Neither DocRouter nor the DocRouter adminstrator will ever see, have access to, or ask you for your password. You should *never* share your password with *any* person, including any person who is or claims to be part of DocRouter or your organization's IT department. Additionally, DocRouter runs on the organization's intranet, which is separated from the public internet. The downside is that you cannot access DocRouter from outside the organization's network (unless you have VPN access), but the upside is that the information contained in DocRouter is better protected.

## Do I need a DocRouter account?
It depends. Certain tools in DocRouter are secured behind administrative credentials that we issue to verified users. [Contact us](mailto:Police_JAIC@co.pg.md.us?subject=DocRouter-Access) if you think you need access.

## Whats in it for you? 
It will sound strange to most people, but we don't do this for money. We don't get paid to build these tools. We really enjoy programming and see endless opportunities to apply our limited skills to projects that, hopefully, make your job a little easier. It is rewarding to build something and see people actually use it in the field without prompting or pressure from higher up, because it means that we've built something *helpful.* There is no higher compliment.
